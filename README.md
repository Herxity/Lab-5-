# Embedded Systems Lab 5
This is the repository for the GRISC processor designed in my Embedded Systems course. The code as-is may struggle to work since the Vivado directory was not pulled in its entirety due to size. 
This microproceesor is capable of connecting to UART interfaces as well as VGA.
